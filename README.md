# ReadMe - My resume
----------------------

![My Resume](ADD PHOTO)

This website is been created to display my resume.
Its scope is to provide to possible employers a better experience than the one given by a Curriculum Vitae
printed on a sheet of paper.

You can visit my resume by clicking [here](https://fral96.github.io/Milestone-2/).

## 1. UX

### 1.1 Project goals

This resume website is been designed to help both potential employers and myself.

The idea is that an employer with a vacant position in his company could view my website
and get an idea about me and about my coding skills (at least enough to convince him to contact me).

This will certainly also be a big help for myself as it could be a useful tool in getting an employment in this field.

In fact, in my opinion in looking for a position in such creative work field, is needed something more creative than a simple printed resume.
